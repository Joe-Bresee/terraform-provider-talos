# talos_machine_configuration_apply (Resource)

The machine configuration apply resource allows to apply machine configuration to a node

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "talos_machine_secrets" "this" {}

data "talos_machine_configuration" "this" {
  cluster_name     = "example-cluster"
  machine_type     = "controlplane"
  cluster_endpoint = "https://cluster.local:6443"
  machine_secrets  = talos_machine_secrets.this.machine_secrets
}

data "talos_client_configuration" "this" {
  cluster_name         = "example-cluster"
  client_configuration = talos_machine_secrets.this.client_configuration
  nodes                = ["10.5.0.2"]
}

resource "talos_machine_configuration_apply" "this" {
  client_configuration        = talos_machine_secrets.this.client_configuration
  machine_configuration_input = data.talos_machine_configuration.this.machine_configuration
  node                        = "10.5.0.2"
  config_patches = [
    yamlencode({
      machine = {
        install = {
          disk = "/dev/sdd"
        }
      }
    })
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `client_configuration` (Attributes) The client configuration data (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--client_configuration))
- `machine_configuration_input` (String, Sensitive) The machine configuration to apply
- `node` (String) The name of the node to bootstrap

### Optional

- `apply_mode` (String) The mode of the apply operation
- `config_patches` (List of String) The list of config patches to apply
- `endpoint` (String) The endpoint of the machine to bootstrap
- `on_destroy` (Attributes) Actions to be taken on destroy, if *reset* is not set this is a no-op.

> Note: Any changes to *on_destroy* block has to be applied first by running *terraform apply* first,
then a subsequent *terraform destroy* for the changes to take effect due to limitations in Terraform provider framework. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--on_destroy))
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) This is a unique identifier for the machine
- `machine_configuration` (String, Sensitive) The generated machine configuration after applying patches

<a id="nestedatt--client_configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `client_configuration`

Required:

- `ca_certificate` (String) The client CA certificate
- `client_certificate` (String) The client certificate
- `client_key` (String, Sensitive) The client key


<a id="nestedatt--on_destroy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `on_destroy`

Optional:

- `graceful` (Boolean) Graceful indicates whether node should leave etcd before the upgrade, it also enforces etcd checks before leaving. Default true
- `reboot` (Boolean) Reboot indicates whether node should reboot or halt after resetting. Default false
- `reset` (Boolean) Reset the machine to the initial state (STATE and EPHEMERAL will be wiped). Default false


<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
